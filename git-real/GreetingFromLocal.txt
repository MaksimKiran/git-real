This file was created in Maksim's local repository, of the same name: git 
real. The goal is to write something locally, terminal only, and have it 
show up on my GitHub account. Reading this file on GitHub confirms the successful
transfer (push) of a commit from a local repositorium to my remote repositorium.

This line was not present in the original version of this file.
